From the brilliant mind who complained until I made **Drop All Inventory** and the glorious muscles that would do anything to make that complaining stop comes:

# Who's Next?


**Who's Next?** allows the next colonist and previous colonist keys to switch between pawns other than colonists on the current map.

## Instructions

[hr][/hr]
1. Select a pawn.
2. Press '' or '' to select and center the camera on the previous or next pawn of that type.
    - Prisoners
    - Animals (wild)
    - Animals (belonging to the same faction)
    - Human pawns of another faction
    - (Switching between colonists works as normal)

**Update 1.0.1:** This function will now also include corpses of the appropriate type when cycling between pawns.
**Update 1.0.2:** Added settings menu with an option to allow/forbid cycling between living pawns and corpses. (Currently 1.3 only)
